== Coding Guidelines

[quote]
Good code should read like a story; not like a puzzle.

=== Casing
==== Typescript
. _PascalCase_ - Classes
. _camelCase_ - variables, functions
. _snake_case_ - db columns, types

=== Comments
. Use multi-line comment format always (even if you are commenting a single line).
. `@use` JSDoc annotations in the comments as much as possible.

=== Formatting
==== File Header
Use below file header as template for all files.

[code, typescript]
----
/**

 * @license This code is licensed under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file 
 * in the project root for full license information.
 * @fileoverview API based test driver for the CrudEngine library using Express.js
 */
----

==== Line Spacing
. Separate logical sections of code with blank lines; exactly one blank line between sections.

==== Tab/Space
. ???

==== Semicolon/No Semicolon
. ???

=== Error Handling

[quote]
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.

==== Typescript
. Always throw object of type `Error`. Add ESLint rule for the same. link:https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-throw-literal/[ref]
. Throw a new `Error` with `{cause: oldError}` instead of re-throwing `oldError`
. Use constant error messages (for log monitoring/error tracking tools). Use `Utils.BaseError` instead of plain `Error` and provide variable data as `context`. Example `throw BaseError("Insert Failed", { causeError, {recordId} })`
+
NOTE: Only provide relevant info in the context. Not too little; not too much.
+
. Donâ€™t throw errors for problems that are expected to happen. Have a flag `success` and return error message to the user in case of a failure (instead of crashing the app).

NOTE: Refer link:https://medium.com/with-orus/the-5-commandments-of-clean-error-handling-in-typescript-93a9cbdf1af5[5 Commandments of Clean Error Handling in Typescript | Medium]

=== Version Control
. Always *diff merge* the code; don't overwrite files.

=== External Dependencies
. Don't integrate any external code/library into our code, without getting prior approval.

=== Icon Files
. Always save icons as `.svg` file and load it using React's *SVGR*. Make sure `stroke="currentColor"` is present in `.svg` file (in order to control it's color during dark/light modes)

=== CSS
. Always use *daisyUI*'s classes and then *tailwind* classes suggested by daisyUI. Don't add arbitrary tailwind CSS classes anywhere. 


== Other Guidelines
=== Use of LLMs
. Use IDE integrated way; not the "chat window" mode. If you happens to use "chat window", give it as much as *context* as possible.

=== Code Review Request (PR Checklist)
For a change to be considered for review, below are the mandates.

* [x] Code Cleanup (no unnecessary files, no commented code, no debug code, etc.)
* [x] Formatting/Linting
* [x] Code should comply with all Coding Guidelines
* [x] Code must be unit-tested and proof of unit-testing (Test Reports, Logs & Code Coverage Report) must be attached. 
* [x] If it is new code or if the changes are huge, the author must walkthrough the code and give a demo.
